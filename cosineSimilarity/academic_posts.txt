Should I take Animal Bx BIBB2140/231 or Drugs Brain Mind 2270/270 with Biochem and Orgo 2

If I take Animal Bx I can take this other class I want and fulfill core major req ,
but penn course review says Drugs Brain Mind is better overall and I think I'd do better as more of my friends are also taking that class as well.
soo.. what did you decide :)

Hi!

I am looking into doing an exchange at King's and was hoping to talk to anyone who has been through the process before - if anyone can share their exchange experience at King's from Penn in general, that would be amazing :)

For an exchange at King's, how easy/difficult was it to get King's courses approved as Penn credit through XCAT? If anyone can speak specifically about getting Computer Science courses approved, that would be great!

And any SEAS students who can share their exchange experiences at any other institution, please do - it would be extremely helpful.

Thank you!
Urgent Questions about Advanced Registration
Academic/Career
How does registration priority work? Can I rank everything as first priority? Should I rank credit-bearing courses first or non-credit-bearing courses first?

How does strategy work with this new system? Does cascade method still work?

Thanks!
can't find writing seminar on Path@Penn?
Academic/Career
In addition to a bunch of problems with the new system I can't seem to find or register for any courses that fulfill the writing requirement. Anyone else having this issue or know how to get around it?

I‚Äôm applying to Upenn this fall and I always wanted to apply to Wharton, but from everywhere I‚Äôve got to know it‚Äôs very hard to get into. Now, I changed my mind to CAS. Will applying to CAS increase my chance of getting accepted?

Spent the last two semesters in math 114 and 240 and am not tryna ruin my Fridays like that again. I also noticed in course registration that you don't need to book a Friday lab/quiz section.

Most of my schedule is engineering classes and I have one class spot left that I want to use as a GPA booster. Im taking FNCE 100 next sem too. How much of the ACCT 101 class gets an A??

Edit: also assuming that I can get into FNCE 100 even if I‚Äôm not taking ACCT 101 concurrently?

Today I went to have lunch. I wanted to have some fruit but all their small ass plates were dirty and sticky. It was disgusting, some of them were yellow like wtf. So in turn, I go and grab a disposable cup because I ain't trying to get sick from the poor hygiene that Penn dining has.

I was wearing headphones so the fruit lady starts YELLING AT ME. She was screaming telling me I couldn't use a disposable cup because I paid to dine in, not to take out - ah yes, I wanna steal all the stale fruit from fucking Hill.

I explained to her that the plates were dirty and she said "there's no way all plates are dirty". I showed her the plates and she was like "well go grab another one from a different station" and the fucking lady left the dirty plates out for everyone to grab after she acknowledged that they were dirty. People continue eating from them even after I told the manager because she didn't even bother to take them out.

Fucking disgusting the most disgusting thing I've seen done by Penn dining.

I'm so tired of the fucking reprehensible food quality at Penn and we get charged as if we are having any quality food or service. DISGUSTING


Student
Sorry for your experience, sometimes the dining staff's attitude really makes me want to cry and yell back. Like I know that dining staff are underpaid but that's no excuse for some of the extremely rude behaviors they've thrown at the students.

Yesterday I was at Lauder trying to get some more food because I was STARVING because of the tiny portion I got the first time. The line's long as usual (which means it goes beyond the PennCard swipe counter by a lot) and all the people were waiting for the featured entree which I was not getting. I went to the regular entree session and asked for some food but the lady YELLED at me and INSISTED that I had to get in line to get food. Like WTF should I be paying ANOTHER swipe and wait for another 20 minutes to get back to the place just to get some more food?

I remember that I once overheard a conversation at KCECH where the Dining manager was sitting and talking to someone about this. She said something along the lines of, "do you know how much these kids are paying for the food? they're paying 13 dollars per swipe. That's why I tell my staff that I never want to hear "no come back for seconds" they should get whatever food they want."

I was always annoyed by the dining staff at commons and hill refusing to give me the food I want and being very rude about it. Never happened at KCECH. In fact the staff at KCECH has consistently been excellent and polite. They aren't paid any more than other dining halls I would assume.

I think that this has nothing to do with pay and everything to do with the culture that is enforced by management.

Yes! The staff at KCECH are so much nicer than those at Hill. I only go to Hill occasionally for the variety, but the quality and kindness at KCECH can't be beaten by any other dining hall on campus, in my opinion. If you're nice to them, they're nice to you.

PhD, Biomedical Graduate Studies, Class of 2017
As someone who attended Penn as a graduate student, I've always been fascinated by the dining hall situation. At Rutgers where I completed my undergrad, we have 5 campuses at the flagship location, and 4 giant dining halls (because Cook/Douglass consists of two campuses but they are intermingled, so 1 dining hall serves both). I mostly lived on Busch Campus, and the dining hall was massive. Rutgers built a new dining hall for Livingston Campus about 10 years ago, and this photo only shows about 1/4th of it. You purchased a meal swipe plan and got unlimited food per entry.

Even at Boston University, where my brother attended undergrad, even though the dining halls are attached to dorms, they still are pretty large and offer some solid meal options.

Meanwhile, according to the Penn undergrads who worked in the lab I was in, Penn has a bunch of tiny dining halls attached to dorms. And you don't really have just meal swipes, you also have dining dollars or something like that?

I guess the purchasing system can vary across universities and still work, that's fine, but what boggles my mind is that a campus as geographically condensed as Penn doesn't have one giant dining facility for all undergrads. Or maybe two dining halls, one by the towers and one that was constructed as part of the new'ish dorms on Chestnut and 34th? Why is your dining system so fragmented?

It‚Äôs really not even the multiple tiny dhalls that are the problem (see Harvard, Yale and Princeton‚Äôs systems) . A school that‚Äôs actually committed to a campus culture that isn‚Äôt by default dominated by the richest mfs there would

1)never EVER have tiers of dhall plans/disparate numbers of swipes depending on how much you pay. Unlimited for everyone. The money/infrastructure spent keeping track of how many swipes are used where would be better spent on literally anything else. Undergrads are adolescents. Let them eat, tf.

2) TRY to have good food options without nerfing them until they are useless( whatever nonsense they have going on at Quaker kitchen that makes it impossible to eat there has resulted in me having 0 idea if the food is even good there. Haven‚Äôt been to lauder either, but the replies in this thread make me think that whatever improvement there is to the food, there are equally bad things that Penn introduced, just so it won‚Äôt be too good.

For a brief second, Houston hall was good, especially at the end of last year where you could use meal swipes for a variety of things. Then they nerfed the meal swipe thing so you could only get the worst foods with a swipe. Like if a swipe is truly worth 17$, why can I only use it to purchase the SHITTIEST meals at Houston? I digress)

3) realize the program that they have where many of the dhall workers have physical or mental disabilities, while admirable (don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt understand that penn is probably getting some huge tax break to do this), is simply not working. Like the shit is just straight up non-functional. So many stories in this thread that I find unacceptable to the point that if it happened to me in undergrad I would have reported it. I have watched and personally been berated/borderline body shamed for asking for certain foods/seconds in BOTH hill and 1920 commons. I‚Äôm just too old to care now and at a stage in eating disorder recovery where I‚Äôll be fine, but still mad for you guys. This is not good.

Aside from the clear worker animosity toward anybody eating in the dhall, which is maybe understandable because, you know, penn students ( no hate I‚Äôm just saying I believe they have challenging experiences with us as well), THE WORK IS SIMPLY NOT BEING DONE. The dining halls are filthy all the time‚Ä¶Terrible, awful, food hygiene practices (think: you finally get someone‚Äôs attention to serve you hot food and they just put their cell phone down and tear you off a piece of pizza with an ungloved hand‚Äîreader, this has happened to me at least 7 times THIS YEAR). There are hardly ever any cups/plates/utensils and they have us eating off paper way too often. Fruit from the fruit station literally terrifies me now after I‚Äôve gotten full on secretory diarrhea from cantelope twice.

I love the idea of giving people who may not have other options for employment a place at Penn, but I‚Äôm not sure if anyone is happy with this arrangement (aside from the university tax office or whatever).

Had to get it off my chest lol.

I submitted comments to this effect on the spring dinning survey, and told as many people as I could to fill it out and give comments bc lowkey it seems that they‚Äôre not aware how bad the problem is.

As you‚Äôre probably aware, NOTHING at penn changes unless by FORCE. I have almost no pony in this race bc after this semester I likely will never eat at a penn dining hall again (happy about this tbh). But for the people coming up, it may be worth it to try to organize and voice these concerns in a way that gets their attention.

Penn dining needs an overhaul. It is not on par with peer institutions. If food is at all important to you, I would not come here until it‚Äôs fixed, and being forced to do 2 years of it‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a freaking violation bro. It‚Äôs not that the food just sucks; in fact, the entire experience of using the dhall at penn is extremely depressing.

Ha, you really let it all out! But I was def looking for exactly this, the current undergrad real world experience.

Maybe everyone has gotten more angry in the last 15 years, but Rutgers Dining Services workers were actually pretty cool in my experience back in undergrad, even though they had to deal with dumbass students. We never really chatted with them much, just saying "thank you" whenever they served us at a station.

I guess this is me being biased, but the Rutgers student population is definitely different than Penn, so maybe we were more appreciative and nice overall? The folks who post on this sub seem legit, but you know how all your classmates are, Locust Walk is like a fashion runway with how much wealth they flaunt. It's just a totally different upbringing vibe at Rutgers.

We have dining plan tiers at Rutgers, but all it differs on is how many swipes you get in a semester. Freshman and sophomores tend to get more swipes vs juniors and seniors, some of whom may live off campus those years and choose to cook their own meals some of the time. But no matter whether you have a 210 swipe plan or a 50 swipe plan, it's all unlimited food every time you go. We do have dollars attached to our Rutgers cards, but that's for private food and convenient store vendors on campus, like Wendy's and Panda Express and such. It's not officially integrated with Rutgers Dining Services, as your semi-private vendors seem to be.

Even if things operated excellently, the decentralized nature of your system seems really annoying.

How an Ivy League School Turned Against a Student
Just unbelievable reporting by the New Yorker. I'm truly aghast at the actions of the University...specially the questioning by Provost, Beth Winkelstein.

"After asking about Mackenzie‚Äôs time in foster care, Winkelstein moved on to her college essay. ‚ÄúYou describe an experience,‚Äù Winkelstein said. ‚ÄúAnd ultimately you say it was your mother. If we review your medical records, is it going to show broken ribs and injuries to your facial area?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Mackenzie said.

‚ÄúAnd you reported this to your school?‚Äù"

I guess the University's point is that there was not enough damage done to Mackenzie. Not enough blood. Not enough neglect. That some picture of her riding a pony erases her story. But the cherry on top of the sundae.... the fact that all of this unraveled as she helped the case of the widow of a man who died, allegedly, because of the University's negligence. Yikes.

I really hope this goes to a grand jury.

I‚Äôm tired of the fetishization of M&T students.
The females on this campus are out of control. The first time I ate lunch wearing my M&T shirt (with fully covered legs, mind you), I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

Anyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 3 months and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last STAT 431 midterm. Girl, I don't struggle with STAT 431. I'm an M&T student, not some single degree simpleton. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT in fact want to copulate in a Huntsman GSR, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am enrolled in the hardest program at Penn (which was not difficult for me to get into, by the way).

The worst are when students from the college attempt to talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: "What's your major?" As soon as I say those two magnificent letters, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. What makes a PPE major think they have a chance with me? Finance and CIS are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that makes infographics about the gender pay gap for "work."

You may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in LSM (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in the world in Destiny 2. My gray shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch Rick and Morty with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout "pickle rick" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic episode of season 3. Not that I cried.

If you want somebody for cheap sex, the LSM students are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding PPE majors though). Stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was an LSM student, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. But I have a responsibility to save the world and create the next Tesla. Seductively asking for me to be your CIS 160 tutor isn't going to make me want to get with you. Come back in a Morty costume, get a return offer from Sequoia, or implement Djikstra's recursively, and then we'll talk.

Please put yourself first
Feeling sick to my stomach after the email we all just received. Second undergraduate death within one month, both of them presumably from suicide.

I know this place can feel so overwhelming, sad, and lonely sometimes. Please just know that there are always a million more reasons to stay, no matter what is going on in your life. I‚Äôve been there before, I get it, but try to remember your family, friends, and other loved ones and how much you matter to them. If you don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to, please talk to me. I know we all make jokes about how cutthroat this school is sometimes, but the truth is that this is a community and I care deeply about your wellbeing. All of us have our entire lives waiting ahead. Life has only just begun. There will always be a light at the end of the tunnel.

Be safe, be well, and please put your mental and physical wellness above all else. I‚Äôm here for you, and I‚Äôm sure there are countless others that are too. We all need a little help sometimes, please don‚Äôt be afraid to ask <3

One of the things that always bothered me during my time at Penn was the lack of school pride. Yeah, sure, Wharton quarterzips are endemic in Huntsman and boomers love buying school-branded nappies for their kids and during spring you can't walk two steps without running into someone wearing a P sweater, but let's face the facts: if a school's pride was based off what people wore, our mascot would be a goddamn flock of geese.

There's a state school to our northwest that knows a thing or two about pride. Why? Simple: they're better at marketing themselves. And the most important part? They have a catchy phrase to tie everything together: #WeAre.

You see that hashtag everywhere in State College. On Twitter, at their football games-- hell, they'll even shout it at random campus groups when they walk past. #WeAre has taken over their entire school identity. Their alums can yell "We Are!" and be instantly recognized for who they are. What catchphrase do we have, "Go Quakers"? "Yeah, Let's Get Lunch Sometime!"? To up our school pride, Penn needs something similar. Something short, catchy, and yellable.

Which is why I'm proposing a new catchphrase: #PennIs.

This single catchphrase has the ability to take our school pride to the next level. We need to get #PennIs trending on Twitter. We need to yell "PENN IS" at the top of our voices at random unsuspecting prefrosh during Quaker Days-- which, incidentally, should be renamed "Penn Is Days". Aptly named because it gives freshmen the main thrust of what #PennIs during their time here!

Football game attendance is-- has been-- declining. If we give the masses something catchy to yell at football games-- "PENN IS!!"-- more people will show up. The band can brand #PennIs on the toast before throwing it on the field. Adopting #PennIs might allow us to top Playboy Magazine's Party School Rankings once again. Penn could even partner with Canada Goose to make high-quality winter coats with a #PennIs emblazoned proudly on the sleeves.

School pride is shrinking, but if we work hard, we can spread school spirit like never before.

PENN IS!!!!!!!

if you have another side of the story, share it or shut up.
I am very tired of hearing people say there is another side to the Castle story, and then not sharing what it is. If you know something, tell the public. Tell the police. None of y'all chose to talk to the DP when they asked. None of y'all are submitting further evidence to the DP's newstip email. You're just spreading rumors online. You're cowards, defending the richest spoiled kids on campus. xoxo

How an Ivy League School Turned Against a Student
News
Just unbelievable reporting by the New Yorker. I'm truly aghast at the actions of the University...specially the questioning by Provost, Beth Winkelstein.

"After asking about Mackenzie‚Äôs time in foster care, Winkelstein moved on to her college essay. ‚ÄúYou describe an experience,‚Äù Winkelstein said. ‚ÄúAnd ultimately you say it was your mother. If we review your medical records, is it going to show broken ribs and injuries to your facial area?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Mackenzie said.

‚ÄúAnd you reported this to your school?‚Äù"

I guess the University's point is that there was not enough damage done to Mackenzie. Not enough blood. Not enough neglect. That some picture of her riding a pony erases her story. But the cherry on top of the sundae.... the fact that all of this unraveled as she helped the case of the widow of a man who died, allegedly, because of the University's negligence. Yikes.

I really hope this goes to a grand jury.

One of the crazy things, if I understand correctly, is this whole thing with Penn only started because of tips from outsiders. By being a Rhodes applicant, her recommendations and any other Penn departmental approval are practically an extra endorsement on how she represented her background. Terrible look for Penn

When I read that, all I could think about is the bitter peers she probably had hence why the parent of a student supposedly tipped off the university.

Sounds like a fucking sore loser to me, jealous about her achievements. Ughhh

Honestly how can Penn claim to support survivors and do this to its own students?

Beth Winkelstein and Wendy White should resign, simple as that. What survivor of sexual assault or domestic violence is going to have faith in Penn if this is how they handle shit?

If not, Pritchett and Magill need to clean house in the provost's office

She sued Penn, in the pending civil case Fierceton v. Winkelstein et. al., for retaliation, extortion, etc. This is separate from her student conduct proceeding and is for civil damages -- Penn has tried to keep the lawsuit under wraps but if you look it up you will find it

The appeal she lost was with a review board at the school. It wasn‚Äôt an appeal attached to a legal proceeding.

From the article toward the bottom: ‚ÄúMackenzie‚Äôs social-work degree is still being withheld. She learned last week that she had lost her appeal. Her degree will not be granted until she submits a letter of apology, a requirement imposed by an appeals panel.‚Äù

Penn is abusing her nearly as much as her mother did - because they don‚Äôt want to be accountable for someone‚Äôs actual death.

I think it was buried in the article somewhere, but it did say she lost it last week (as of the time of publishing, I imagine).

Right like even the PolSci professors who wrote the opinion in support of her question the ruthlessness of their campaign against her‚Ä¶the article makes me think this was retaliation of the highest order for her role in the lawsuit of the man who died due to Penn‚Äôs negligence.

Loved the New Yorker article. What is incredible to me is the media coverage of this story. Most of it was UPenn and their biased narrative regurgitated by uninspired and un-investigative journalists. The so-called journalists that have propagated this further abuse of Mackenzie, knowingly or unknowingly are complicit. UPenn and the media outlets they used to smear an abuse victim should pay enough in damages that this sort of thing never happens again. As far as I can tell the only problem they have with Mackenzie is that she hasn't been poor and abused long enough and that she has witnessed in a wrongful lawsuit against themThey are monsters.

One of the allegations in Mackenzie‚Äôs lawsuit against UPenn is that the Inquirer editor who ordered a hit piece on Mackenzie is the spouse of UPenn‚Äôs PR head. Not even surprising at this point‚Ä¶

I'm a current senior and every friend I have discussed this with is absolutely livid.

However, this behavior does not necessarily come as a surprise: it merely reflects the institution's same dishonest, self-serving practices that gave us anti-student policies throughout the COVID pandemic (e.g. cancelling fall and spring breaks, extending the mask mandate, and many other extremely restrictive policies)

Maybe I'm in a bubble, but the vast majority of my peers are deeply unhappy with the way Penn has been run the previous two years.

Perhaps things will improve now that Amy Gutmann (who appears to have been asleep at the wheel, instead focused on her own political ambitions and Penn's donor class) has exited.

Amy Gutmann js the reason this type of stuff is happening. She whored out the Penn name for donations. Every dollar mattered more than truth or morals for her and those that supported her methods. This is why I don‚Äôt donate to the school. I‚Äôm still paying off student loans, but the school always exploits freshman volunteers to call us asking for money. Ridiculous.

Renaming Logan Hall to Cohen Hall‚Ä¶ Hamilton to Rodin‚Ä¶ Penn Medical to Perelman‚Ä¶ no wonder Jon Huntsman was so paranoid that they would rename his building to the highest bidder after his death.

UPenn‚Äôs vengeful behavior, actions and attitude pre-dates Amy Gutmann. Judy Rodin led exceptionally vile ‚Äòcampaigns‚Äô against anyone she disliked (alternatively she showered those in her inner orbit with all sorts of perks/money.) In my (former) capacities as both a student and staff member, I speak from direct experience. My ‚Äòjourney‚Äô involved UPenn‚Äôs President‚Äôs office, Penn‚Äôs internal ‚Äúreview‚Äù process, HR, Penn‚Äôs internal counsel as well as Philadelphia court civil litigation. Penn is a major employer and pours money into civic projects; this gives Penn a lot of leverage in a small city like Philadelphia. Penn also has nearly unlimited financial and political resources which they will freely use to completely squish anyone who steps out of line. For Mackenzie to succeed, she will need an advocate that is more powerful than UPenn and that will stay by her side during a long and ugly process.

Wow. Just‚Ä¶ wow. What I would love to know is how this is not a title IX issue. As someone who works at a university, is a mandatory reporter, and has had to sit through a LOT of title IX training I am honestly bewildered as to why university admin felt it was OK to contact a victim‚Äôs abuser. Uni admin is not supposed to handle any alleged cases of abuse, a title IX officer is. And yes, same requirements apply even if the disclosed abuse happens prior to entering college.

The conduct of Wendy White and Beth Winkelstein in this‚Ä¶. WOW. So disgraceful. The bit about Wendy White, upon learning that professors were supporting Mackenzie, tried to get her to sign a form saying she was withdrawing from Rhodes ‚Äúvoluntarily and without pressure‚Äù was sickening.!!!! Hopefully Wendy White is also forced to resign from her post ‚Äúvoluntarily and without pressure.‚Äù

I echo a lot of your feelings and just want to say that it really does suck. Truth is we lost out on some pretty amazing experiences and moments, and we‚Äôre never getting them back. I‚Äôve tried to make the experience a positive one as best I can though. For example, I‚Äôve refined my work ethic so I‚Äôm productive no matter the environment or circumstances. When things were normal, due to my own anxiety/depression, I passed up a lot of opportunities to go out with friends. I‚Äôve learned to take advantage of the opportunities and moments I do have, as I‚Äôve realized things really can change in an instant. I‚Äôve learned to appreciate the small stuff, and I have a whole new perspective on independence (also have been home with dysfunctional family) and freedom. I‚Äôve taken advantage of the extra time from not having to travel anywhere by totally overhauling my physical fitness. So I suppose I‚Äôm dealing with the sadness by learning what I can from the experience. I hope someday I‚Äôll reflect upon this college/COVID disaster and be a wiser and more thoughtful person who makes better decisions because of it. There is nothing that can be done to redo or restart a lost college experience, but I refuse to not grow from my experience‚Äîthis is the line of thinking I circle back to when I start getting the blues from having missed everything.

I believe no matter the depth of the abuse leading up to being admitted to UPenn, what the university has done & the manner which it handled the matter is much worse. Just when the Penn State abuse scandal was not front & center, Univ. of Penn corners the market on abusing the abused. To this day are holding Masters diploma hostage demanding a letter of apology after dragging their student through the mud? Talk about losing the forrest for the trees. Universities used to be a place that takes in students as family & fights to build up the individual. Shameful.


Grief over losing senior year
I am a senior right now and losing my senior year of college has been awful for my mental health. I spent my first two years at Penn struggling with depression and a serious eating disorder so I was never able to apply myself enough to join clubs or have a real social life. I spent junior year in therapy and by Spring 2020 I finally felt like myself again. I joined some clubs and felt like things were going to be okay. Then covid happened. I still felt hopeful because I thought senior year would be the year where I came into myself and would be able to apply everything I had learned to have a great year and graduate feeling proud of my college experience. I truly believe my senior year would have been amazing and made up for the disappointing college years that came before.

Instead I've been stuck in an abusive home environment for a year and will be graduating with very little to show for my college experience. I am so sad that my year will be the only Penn class to have never gotten hey day, feb club, and we possibly won't get graduation either. I had saved so many interesting classes to take my senior year and now I'm having to take them online, which I have a really hard time staying engaged with. I learned almost nothing this past semester online even though I'm taking the most important classes of my major. It makes me incredibly sad that I will never again experience an in person lecture or study in our libraries again. I'll never be able to go to Smokes. All the things that make college worth it, completely stripped. My personal, social, and academic life have all taken serious hits and I don't have another year of college to make up for it.

I guess this is just a post venting about covid and senior year but also I wanted to know if other seniors are experiencing this? No one is talking about it. It felt like the whole world felt bad for the Class of 2020 because they missed two months of college but the Class of 2021 is missing our last 1.5 years of college. (disclaimer that I know this is nothing compared to the actual losses people have experienced this year) I wish the Class of 2021 Board would have some kind of event where we could all reflect and have collective grieving over what we have lost. Because right now I just feel totally isolated and like I'm the only one having such a hard time and missing what could have been of our senior year. It truly feels like grief at this point because I feel so stuck; always thinking about what could have been and also having no way to make it better because there's no way out of our present circumstances.


13
I also feel sad, too, but here‚Äôs the thing. People‚Äôs college careers get disrupted for all kinds of reasons all the time. We just don‚Äôt hear about them because they‚Äôre normally not during a pandemic. People quietly leave school or take short or long breaks because they run out of money, a parent dies, some other family emergency, pregnancy, etc. Not so much at Penn because we‚Äôre an extremely well-funded, high-achieving, driven lot but it‚Äôs common enough. So I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that there is no ‚Äúideal college experience,‚Äù and for me, I have to let go of that in order to move on to the next phase in my life.

College is tough, Ivy league colleges especially so. To try for a Rhodes is ambitious to say the least...to be considered, is commendable for anybody.

My point is that she earned her degrees. I don't want to diminish her childhood traumas in anyway or any challenges she has overcome...but she has been extraordinarily successful in her college years, especially considering all the extra-curricular activities. They can question how she got in (hopefully she will be exonerated)...but how she earned her grades and degrees should never be questioned. She has a right to her degrees and everything else she earned.

Unfortunately her degrees are under threat as well. According to the New Yorker article, they're withholding her masters until she apologizes to the university. They've also threatened taking action against her undergrad degree unless she agrees to give up her summa cum laude (and withdraw from the Rhodes). She withdrew from the Rhodes, not sure what happenened with the Latin honors.

As a Penn alum, I'm sadly not surprised by this type of behavior from administrative 'leadership.' Anea Moore saying, "But one young Black lady with dead parents using a multibillion-dollar Ivy League institution feels entirely different than the institution using her," sums up some of the disillusionment I feel towards my alma mater/most Ivy leagues.

Ughhh. Not that they haven't been entangled in many controversies at this point, but just how they conducted themselves, especially Beth Winkelstein and Wendy White, is outrageous. It's like they went out of their way to throw a student under the bus to save PR face/the billion dollars endowment of name... only to create an even bigger scandal for themselves (which is the lesser issue here, but the common sense/principals of morality and decency is majorly lacking).
