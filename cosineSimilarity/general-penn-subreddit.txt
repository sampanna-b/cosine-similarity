Is it just me or does anyone else think that upenn would be better off if the whole university is named Wharton lmao
Fluff
Wharton’s actually not a bad name lmao and it won’t sound like a public school name anymore.

HS Senior
High key not a bad idea but I like ego checking Penn students with the Penn state comparison

Master's
UC San Diego should also rename itself to UC La Jolla (which is already the school's mailing address) so people stop thinking they go to San Diego State or the private University of San Diego. The school can colloquially shorten itself to just "La Jolla" (like how it's "berkeley.edu" and not "ucberkeley.edu") so it's not a branding/marketing mouthful like it is now. Plus it sounds kind of bougie and elite.

Fun fact: UC San Diego is further from downtown SD than UC Berkeley is from downtown SF.
My sister went to Wharton, unfortunately, she just didn't fit in but she completed her 4 years. It was personally a hard environment for her, there were students so different in backgrounds compared to her. Very wealthy, a lot of elitism. Also while she was there, there was 1 attempted suicide. The thing about Penn is that it can be extremely pre professional so you need to know if you're up for that. She did have a lot of good times too, her classes were good and she liked her professors. In the end, most of the top unis are competitive and mental health is a poor issue with almost all of them
I’m not highly aided or low income but penn pays for like 85% of my total cost of attendance. I can’t pay 5k for a summer course …. does anyone know if I can somehow get grant aid from penn to take one? I know the website makes it seem like it’s very unlikely but wondering if anyone has been able to somehow do so


I don't know whether it is appropriate to post it here. If someone finds it inappropriate just tell me so that I can post this elsewhere. Yes, you can tell me where I can post this to achieve the purpose.

I am an incoming PhD student of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania from China. I have just finished my F-1 visa interview and expect that the visa will be issued two months from now. I just want to ask here whether there is someone that I can rent an apartment with.

Some information about me:

Current location: Beijing, China. Arriving in Philadelphia in mid August.

Research Interests: Condensed Matter Theory, non-Hermitian Physics.

Hobbies: Playing RTS (Starcraft, Age of Empires, etc.) and Hearthstone, POV video lover and filmer, Reading, Cooking (pretty good chef).

Way of living: Regular schedule. Commonly wake up at 9 am in the morning and go to bed at 1 am the next day morning.

I just don't know what to tell you here. If you are interested in
like you've already taken the co-req course (or currently enrolled), but it doesn't know that, so it prevents you from registering.

my profile, just contact me directly. We can make contacts via Twitter, Facebook, or WeChat.
I am in SEAS and my advisor approved my courses on Thursday. I noticed afterward that Path at Penn still said that I was on advisor hold, so I emailed my advisor back. He said that on his end, there was no hold on my account and that I should be fine. However, on Path at Penn, it still says that I am on Advisor Hold and cannot register for courses. What should I do?
so obviously I recognize it’s way too late now to ask for a rescheduled final, but I’m curious so I know for the future: tomorrow is Eid, a Muslim holiday that lasts up to three days, and I have a chem 101 final on Tuesday. Would I have been able to reschedule the exam for later in the final exam period if I asked earlier or would it be expected by my prof that I prioritize the final?

Penn’s official stance is also that any rescheduled exams (they explicitly mention if it’s for religious observances) must be during the “official” postponed exams period, which is the beginning of the next semester, which really sucks. Although some profs might be more willing/able to hold another time for you do to it in the exam period (I think? maybe it’s not allowed though, but maybe it happens). (source: https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/final-examinations/)

I have had luck before getting an exam (albeit midterm) moved very last minute (like asked night before), and it only worked because the prof already had an alternate session scheduled for other students (alternate was morning, instead of night, so I got an email response and had like 2h to confirm and finish cramming, but it turned out alright lol). If you still want to ask, perhaps there is a small chance it might work, but probably be prepared to be denied.
Don't think the official scheduling policy is all that strictly enforced, it's just that you only get as much leniency as the prof is willing to give you.

I have taken a final early personally, and had classes where the final wasn't on our scheduled day. Chem lab, for instance, had the written final during the last week of class, which is explicitly forbidden in the page you linked.

True, they probably don’t have someone auditing all classes/finals being held to make sure they’re following these policies exactly. If they don’t follow something that they’re supposed to allow you, you could probably report it to the school or dean, but they probably wouldn’t get anything more than a slap on the wrist.

Or classes use loopholes, like maybe they call it a “midterm” instead of a “final” so it can be before the finals period.

What did people think of this course? Would you recommend it? The professor seems to be new so I don't have much to go on.
Current sophomore in CAS. The website says applications must be made prior to the end of sophomore year, so does that mean I am still eligible to apply? Only recently realized I wanna do cis and couldn’t finish all pre reqs until this semester. Thanks!

So I'm about to click on UPenn and just need some backing from Upenn engineering again. I narrowed my two options to the state school (UT) and UPenn, leaning on UPenn right now. I received a manageable(?) financial aid package at UPenn, with me still needing to pay about 11+k a year if I add in other living expenses and plane tickets. My other choice is University of Texas at Austin who is offering over a full ride (about 20-30k). I would also have around 16 AP classes of credits for Austin while only 3 AP for UPenn (my school happened to offer a lot of AP credits upenn wouldn't take and I got a few 4s). My major is chemical engineering and I am very interested in doing research . I've been struggling to choose since early this month, with this being my second opinion asking. Any insight would be helpful. I'm flopping around on the decision I should make.

Around 3/4 PM 4/28 the alarm went off in Huntsman saying that something was going on, leave building. Did anything happen, or was it a drill?


So I'm trying to take 121 and/or 262 over the summer but they are both listed as 'hybrid' (see image)

does this mean I can still take the course not being on campus? or does it require being on campus

Thanks!

I’m tired of the fetishization of M&T students.
The females on this campus are out of control. The first time I ate lunch wearing my M&T shirt (with fully covered legs, mind you), I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

Anyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 3 months and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last STAT 431 midterm. Girl, I don't struggle with STAT 431. I'm an M&T student, not some single degree simpleton. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT in fact want to copulate in a Huntsman GSR, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am enrolled in the hardest program at Penn (which was not difficult for me to get into, by the way).

The worst are when students from the college attempt to talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: "What's your major?" As soon as I say those two magnificent letters, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. What makes a PPE major think they have a chance with me? Finance and CIS are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that makes infographics about the gender pay gap for "work."

You may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in LSM (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in the world in Destiny 2. My gray shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch Rick and Morty with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout "pickle rick" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic episode of season 3. Not that I cried.

If you want somebody for cheap sex, the LSM students are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding PPE majors though). Stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was an LSM student, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. But I have a responsibility to save the world and create the next Tesla. Seductively asking for me to be your CIS 160 tutor isn't going to make me want to get with you. Come back in a Morty costume, get a return offer from Sequoia, or implement Djikstra's recursively, and then we'll talk.

For anyone wondering, Management and Technology. It’s some kind of dual degree program between Wharton and Penn Engineering. I’m not Chad enough to be in it so I don’t know much more about it than that.

Isn’t recursively the main way to implement Dijkstra’s?

Once you‘re at a node in the “settled set”, you treat it like the node you started at, and perform dijkstra’s from there (until no more nodes are in the “frontier set”)?

This is specifically because some political science classes have the credit in the recitation and not the lecture. While others have the credit on the lecture and not the recitation...

Asking because I am trying to rank numerically; however, I am wondering I should rank with numbers the ones that have credit while leaving the ones that are not graded in auto??



ORRR should I just raw dog it and have it all as auto?? I am a rising senior desperately trying to meet requirements plsss and some of the classes I know are going to be in big demand next semester for my reqs
