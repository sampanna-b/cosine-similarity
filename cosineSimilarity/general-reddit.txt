The least expensive seats are gray AND the unavailable seats are gray. No way to tell the difference other than hovering over them.

HOA rules need to be followed? Suuuure.
The setup: Our tale begins in my teen years about 10-11 years ago. It was summer and my parents wanted to go on vacation. Me being a 16 year old dumbass with both a gaming addiction and seeing my que to living the free independent unsupervised life, must like a house cat with an open-door-for-two-weeks-opportunity, offered to house- and dogsit while they and my sister went on vacation.

Some important background information is probably needed here, since else some dumbasses here might call my parents neglectful for leaving an 16 year old unsupervised for two weeks: I'm from a way safer and secure place than the US, we lived in the suburb and I was taught most lifeskills by the time I was 12. The only dangers I could be exposed to would be alcohol poisoning, and strains to my wrist from the insane amount of rounds I would force my poor member through during the two weeks. You know, the typical threats for a boy in a country in which 16 year olds can buy beer.

The boy and the Karenmegasaurus Rex: Week one: While gaming took 90% of my time away and I developed the day and night schedule of a backend developer, I still did all the chores around the house with a few exceptions since I deemed they could wait. I check the mailbox and there is a handwritten letter with runes of the ancient.

Using my old doctors notes as a rosetta stone, I decifered, that it was from the president of our equvalent of an HOA. Imagine an HOA with a fifth of the power the typical HOA in US would have. A Hawkeye of the HOA Avengers, if it was in a sport it would only receive participation awards, you get the point. The Moria written tomb said that the grass of my front law was too tall according to regulations. I went out, took a look at the grass, which was maybe 1 cm too tall (that's the equivalent of a jellybean to my freedom measurement folks). Same day I cut the grass, cause might as well do so to keep the peace.

The day after, a new letter written by the same Shakespeare wannabe came. I grabbed my Idiana Jones Hat and performed an heathen ritual in the shed to read the message. The roses in my frontyard were going too far out through the fence by 15 cm (that's an average sized carrot in muricana). I once again comply.

On the third day of shitmas, the true cause of annoyance said to me: my backyards bushes were too tall. Here is where I finally get irritated, since you have to enter my parents property to check the bushes height. With Satans three commandments in hand I go and visit my direct neighbour, who I knew were in the HOA board. I ask her about the Gutterspeak letters and she looks through them and laughs. Those are from the banshee of Arrakis aka the megakaren who lived 10 houses further down the street. She had been kicked out of the HOA board after she poisoned 3 dogs in the neighbourhood with rat poison laced treats. Not wanting to deal with her after she threw rocks at me when I was trick or treating as a child, I decided to let the case rest and leave my bushes be untrimmed like certain minority pornactresses often do.

The boy, the planted bomb and the instigation: Fast forward a week into my parents vacation. After being alone for 7 days, I finally mastered the art of playing Mozarts requiem on the meatflute, and decided to do something else. As any teenager would I started to plan a party, and like the good kid I was, I went around to all my nearby neighbours and warned them about the potential noise, which parties tend to create. At some point here, in my post-nut-clarity, I remembered the saying "bitches be fading, but a good counterstrike match lasts forever". Instead of holding a straight up party I decided to invite friends over to a lan-party, so we could play counterstrike source, and quickly replace the white bloodcells in our body with whatever was in the knockoff energy drinks. Fast forward to said lan-party: my parents dining room smells like teenage farts, axe bodyspray, sweat and all chips in the world mixed together. Typical lan stuff. 1 am there is a loud knock on the door. I go out, to see two cops looking at me with a surprised pikachu face. I look at them with the same amount of confusion.

Cop 1: "We have a report, that there is a loud party going on, and there might be several minors doing drugs here".

Me: "Does energy drinks count as drugs?"

Cop 2: "No?"

Me "Then I have no idea what you are talking about".

Cop 1: "we had a frantic woman calling constantly, which is why we came, but it seems we are more of a disturbance than you guys are"

At the same time one of my friends can be heard in the background:

"OP get in here!! The bomb has been planted and you are the only one alive"

Cop 1: "Counterstrike?"

Me: "Counterstrike.."

"We will leave you to it then".

Cops left and we lost the match. Unrelated tho.

Two days after, I get another knock on my door. There she is, the bane of all good, she who must not be mentioned without carrying Miraak's Sword and a towel on you. She starts screaming that me and my drug party kept her up all night, and that I'm a horrible brat, who needs to tend to my bushes if my parents doesnt want to lose the house. At this point I stop her and remind her that: 1. The HOA doesnt have the power to do that. They hardly have the power to do anything except approve of houseowners requests. 2. That she was kicked out of the HOA due to the poison incident. 3. That I didnt even have a party 4. that she needs to stay the fuck away from my backyard. She got even madder and started screaming that she would have me and my parents arrested, and that the poisoned treats were meant for my dog as well.

I slammed the door on her faster than hyperspacing from Argos Rho. She had royally pissed me off. No one threatens my good boy. No one.

Perfect legal pettiness: So now we are at our final act. My revenge. I had about 4 days before my parents returned, so I made them count. I called the police and visited my real HOA neighbour and got all the nessecary approvals. Then I went over and talked with the neighbours surrounding her house. I would do all the yard work, which involved loud equipment around her house. Legally, we were allowed to make noise from 8am till 8pm with yard work, but its considered rude to do it after 5pm. That didnt stop me tho. Like a druid on paragon level 256 I just kept sending leaves and grass flying, as if all the bushes, trees and odd plants had pissed in my grandfathers ashes. She came out and screamed at me, even threw a rock at me, it brought back old memories but I didnt care. I was gonna make as much legal sound as possible. Whenever she complained I just told her, that their plants werent up to HOA standard.

Friday rolls around. It's 8 am. Me and my friends are gathered in front of her house. We have all the tools ready. Purchased by the bloodcoin of my insanity induced labour the two days prior. It's time to make her pay. We turn on the speaker, the bbq and crack up a beer. Speaker is set to the exact legal limit of how loud the music is allowed to be. Most her neighbours come out and join during the day, since I had invited them while killbilling their plants. She screamed constantly for an hour, called the cops twice, which left after seeing my permits from themselves and the HOA. That's right bitch. If you want a party to complain about, then you shall get the finest party of the shire just outside of your house. We kept it up to the exact time limit.

TL;DR: You want to complain? Sure. I will give you plenty of reasons to do so, but nothing you can do anything about.

Tbh in most of the US you'd be fine leaving a 16 year old to their own devices for 2 weeks provided; all the bills are paid, they have enough food and the ability to get more if need be, and most crucially you know your 16 year old is self sufficient enough to be alone for two weeks without burning everything down. There's also no specific law against it and any charge of neglect would have to be based on conditions, in fact there's actually only a couple of states with minimum ages at which a kid can be home alone, all cases of neglect are predicated on the conditions which obviously age and length of time can be considered for, but for a 16 year old you'd pretty much have to abandon them completely and tell em to figure it out. There are 16 year olds that live as emancipated minors on their own in the US with no guardian at all.

My parents did this when I was 17 in Chicago, went on a 12 day cruise with my younger siblings and left me home with the dog! July 2005 was a ton of fun and my parents house became basically a LAN hangout but with a steady supply of cheap beer and shit weed. We played WoW for days at a time and some friends only went home to change.

As gross as it was, I remember going outside to grill and coming back inside and gagging at the smell of BO in there...it was open windows and a bonfire going at all times to make that go away but that's what you get with twenty or so 16+ year old nerds hanging out

Maybe I read too much into how some people act. I just used the states as an example, since the majority of users here are from the states and therefore gives most a general idea of the safety standard. If I had said more safe than France, it wouldn't translate that well for most. But I've might have been a bit ignorant writing that, my mistake.

reddit absolutely loves to shit on the US. Like, a whole lot. Obviously I am only one person, but from my own experience, 99% of the horrible stories that people tell on here about what the US is like to live in are either outright fabrications, exaggerated to (and usually far past) the breaking point, or are obviously leaving out something that the storyteller did to instigate/escalate things. This is not to say that incidents don't happen, just that from reading reddit you'd think that the utter insanity is a daily occurrence everywhere in the country. It's not.

And it's not just reddit doing this - I remember when the state of Oregon removed a law banning people from pumping their own gas. Oregon has a population of 4.2 million. Out of those 4.2 million people, one ancient geezer that some local news agency interviewed said some ridiculousness about "how do we know it's safe to let people pump their own gas?????" (the joke being that at the time 48 other states, plus who knows how many countries, have had self-serve gas for decades). One person, possibly with early onset dementia and who had never left their state in their lives, out of 4.2 million people, said that, but to see the news coverage about it you'd think the entire state was up in arms. It's sickening.

Federal taxes allow babysitter deductions until the summer after your thirteenth birthday, but that does assume a parent overnight.

I also stayed home when I was 16 for 10 days while my parents and sisters were on vacation. I had no interest in going. I took care of the pets and chores. I was left with food and money. Neighbors and friends checked in on me. I was perfectly fine! I think it really depends on the teen and level of maturity though.

Enjoyed the read. Im super confused over where its NOT acceptable to leave a 16 year old home alone for multiple weeks? I think at age 13 my parents left me at home for 2 weeks for a cruise. It was awesome and I was perfectly able to take care of myself and the house.

For real. I‚Äôm in the US, and my parents started leaving me home for two weeks every summer starting when I was 12. It‚Äôs not dangerous as long as the kid in question is fairly responsible and knows who to call in an emergency.

Sometimes I‚Äôm shocked at what folks from other places think about this country, then I read the news and sigh with resignation and shame.

I mean‚Ä¶. All of the US news is out there and highlighted because it‚Äôs cool to hate on us. All other country‚Äôs have their fair share of stupid ass people that make the news we just won‚Äôt see it if it‚Äôs from say Germany.

I know plenty of English as a first language people who don't know the difference between "cue" and "queue", or who (like OP) mash the two words together to create "que".

If somone gets caught trying to poision a dog, they should not be walking free for several years. We've all seen John Wick, and we all know that you just don't mess with someone's dog...

I agree there. I know she settled out of court and that the dogs survived (luckily). One of the dogs was a sausage dog named Rasmus and belonged to an old Lady. He later died of old age, and the old Lady would walk up and down the street looking for him. She was later put in a retirement home since her dementia got real bad and then later passed away herself. From her son I heard, that Rasmus was the only one she never forgot. I'm just happy he got to live his full life and bring joy to his owner in his last years.

If someone poisoned my pet they would be strapped down and whatever poison they used shoved in their mouth which would then be duct taped shut.

My cat used to do this to my downstairs bathroom. She died in November. I live alone.
