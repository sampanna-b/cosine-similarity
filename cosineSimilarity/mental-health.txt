Congratulations! You did it! If you're eager to learn more about Penn, here are some words of advice for the Penn Class of '23 from a current Penn freshman.

Put yourself out there.

New Student Orientation (NSO) is when everyone is looking to make friends. Try to balance between making quality vs. quantity friends. For me personally, I knew most of my high school class since elementary or middle school, so I really put a lot of effort (especially as an introvert) on being able to make new friends in college. This is the chance to forget all the dumb mistakes and embarassing moments from high school. You don't have to be the same person that you used to be, so put yourself out there. These could be the last four years where you'll be in the same space as a large number of your peers where people are open to making new connections and learning from each other.

Develop time management skills.

There are so many things going on all the time on campus. You will likely need to devote some time to learn how to use Google Calendar and an agenda/planner or some organizational system if you don't already. If you got by without being very organized in high school, I can guarantee that it's much harder to do in college. I'd recommend scheduling the important activities in your life first: sleep, eating, being active, and having time for yourself. These are my priorities because if I don't take care of myself, my mental and physical health both go to shit and I can't get anything done.

Stop procrastinating. Try to start your homework as soon as possible. One strategy I learned was to schedule time in between your classes to do homework so you don't waste too much time doing nothing. Another I learned was to set a cutoff period of time: work as hard as you can until, for example, 9 PM, and then just cut yourself off from work and chill with your friends. This helps you avoid burnout. Also, it's much harder to break a cycle of being behind in college. If you start strong, it's much more likely that you'll end strong.

Consider what you want from college.

I decided that I wanted to grow in a number of different ways. For me, I was finally able to accomplish a lot of goals that I had for a long time, but never pursued previously. I think I learned somewhere that with big life changes, you're more likely to be able to form new habits than on a daily basis. I started lifting (7AM Pottruck, anyone?), eating healthier, became more organized, got more sleep, and procrastinated less. Personally, I want to learn more about myself and the world.

Figure out a tentative four year plan by the end of your first year.

This is especially important if you want to study abroad or do multiple majors/concentrations/minor! Although it is a bit much to plan out all four years of your college within the first 25%, I believe that it's important to do a tentative plan so that you can research the requirements and understand what you really need to take. Consider what classes can count for multiple requirements. Some schools use RateMyProfessor, but we have PennCourseSearch and PennCourseReview (the latter requires PennKey access, I forget about the former). If you're in a special program (M&T/Huntsman/BFS), there will be specific requirements for your curriculum, and it's important that you get started as soon as possible to fulfill these requirements.

Your advisor will help you register for classes! We have this thing called "Advance Registration", where within a two week period, as long as you have your requests in by the end of the period, your requests will be submitted. After advance registration ends, an algorithm will determine what classes everyone will take based on everyone's requests and how everyone ranks their preferences. Schedules will be available for view a couple weeks or so after the end of Advance Registration. If you don't get into your classes, use PennCourseNotify; it will email you when someone drops the class!

You don't have to go into consulting or finance.

Yes, a LOT of Penn students do, so it is feasible. But if you don't give a shit about consulting or finance, don't do it just because everyone else is. Find something you're actually interested in so that you don't have to suffer learning and doing things you don't actually care about. Penn is such a great institution and there's so much more to learn than consulting or finance.

Figure out what your limits are.

If you're not sure if you want to drink or do drugs when you get to Penn, I'd recommend making the decision before you come to campus. If you say no, stick with it. You can still have fun, but the odds of you having fun at parties are significantly lower, and that's completely okay.

If you say yes, please have tried these things in a safe environment and know what your limits are. Count your drinks. Be careful about who you accept your drinks from. Don't do anything too stupid. It's not fun waking up in the hospital having blacked out and gotten MERTed (Medical Emergency Response Team).

Get the Penn Mobile App when you get to campus.

It tells you what washers and dryers are available, what dining halls are open, and lets you book group study rooms. I'm sure there are more functions, but these are the most important/useful ones. During NSO, dining halls' schedules are subject to change and may not be reflected on the app, so be wary of that.

College shopping list with miscellaneous advice:

Invest in good waterproof shoes and an umbrella, and keep the umbrella in your backpack. (Check the weather daily.)

Acetominophen/Ibuprofen, thermometer, cough drops: you will likely get sick. If you don't have meds and your friends don't either/are busy, it will be treacherous to walk all the way to CVS when your limbs feel like they're going to fall off your body.

Get a warm winter jacket: it doesn't have to be Canada Goose or Moncler.

Learn to layer: invest in thermals. I recommend Uniqlo Heattech-- super lightweight and very warm.

Don't necessarily listen to everyone who says to get the dining plan with the most dining dollars.

This is an unpopular opinion, but if you want to eat three meals a day, I recommend getting the dining plan with the most swipes. Yes, you'll have to sit down and it's not convenient if you have many back-to-back classes around lunch time (Hill just introduced continuous service though, so this isn't really an argument anymore anyway), but nothing's better than being able to eat until you're full and not worry about how many dining dollars you have left. If you really don't have time to sit down in the dining halls and eat, you can also get a to-go container. Hill and New College House (NCH) and Hillel are the best dining halls, hands down. They have healthy options that still taste good. Mclelland is convenient for breakfast and late-night, but their food is slightly questionable. Only very slightly. Anyone who talks mad shit about Mclelland breakfast has probably never actually eaten breakfast at Mclelland.

Don't be afraid to ask for help.

Penn is going to challenge you in many ways, and that's perfectly okay. Don't forget that Penn is an institution with all the resources it has. CAPS, your advisor(s), your RA/GA, and your friends! CAPS has a bad reputation. But if you need someone to talk to or are just going through some things, I'd HIGHLY recommend going to CAPS. Also, be real with your friends; they want to help! Don't be afraid to talk to friends from home; they're probably going through similar things. And if they're not, then that doesn't mean that they aren't willing to listen.

Consider your mindset.

No matter what happens, it's ok. Having resilience is much more important than being successful at first. Eventually everyone is going to have setbacks, and if you're resilient, then you can get through anything. Accept that shit happens. It's okay.

Grades aren't everything. Don't take them too seriously. They aren't everything.

Your mindset is a large determining factor in your success. Know that things will be okay and that you can keep moving forward.

Enjoy the rest of your senior year and your summer!

It only comes once!

Best of luck! :) Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or just want to talk about Penn.
This is really good advice, especially the part about setting a limit at night to stop doing work. Of course there are going to be some nights where you have a lot of work or exams and you need to stay up late and finish them, but that does not need to be your norm. There’s no need for you to be pulling regular all nighters or doing work till midnight every day as long as you have a decent time management system. Prioritize your well being!


Incoming international freshman at CAS over here.

Thank you so much for the advice! Even though there is that sense of confidence about going to college, I cannot thank you enough for reminding about the need to kind of have that humility about the entire experience!

The earlier this is done, the better, especially in regards to picking classes. Be very deliberate with your course choices if you have a very good sense of the majors/minors you would like to do because it gives you more flexibility later on if you see you'd like to challenge yourself with another major/minor if that's your thing. Take the first year to explore, but if you will explore beyond first year, definitely keep in mind the sector/liberal arts requirements along the way by doing @ least one a semester to stay on track for graduation.

And please be sure to ask other, older Penn students and Penn redditors for course recommendations, best professors, classes to avoid, etc. Don't settle for less, make sure you get the best professors for the courses you take, especially the large lecture ones (Ex. Prof. Nakia Rimmer for math courses).
So I’m considering applying to Penn early decision but hailing from California I’ve never visited the school or even the state of Pennsylvania. I have no idea what to expect so I’m wondering what I should be aware of/might not like if I get in. For those of you who don’t know how early decision works, basically if you get accepted you’re required to attend the school, so I’m a bit nervous about applying. (I can’t visit due to the obvious financial constraint of having to fly across the country.) If it matters, I’d probably be applying for Wharton/Econ. Thanks.

CAS '21
Wintertime

Philadelphia

Excessive drinking

Difficult academics and stressful culture.

What some people like others hate.
To build on/respond to this:

Philly wintertime isn’t too bad, so long as you layer clothes you’re fine 99% of the time. Also way more temperate winter than any other Ivy so if OP is caught between Ivys, then that’s something to consider.

Philadelphia isn’t in itself a drawback either. It gets stale if you stay in the Penn Bubble though. Philly sports fans need to chill tf out but otherwise it’s not much better or worse than any other city, and it’s definitely cheaper than many others.

Excessive drinking is an ish, for sure but it’s not super unique to Penn and also isn’t mandated in any way. If OP doesn’t want to drink much, they’ll find other ways to have fun.

Last point is def the biggest issue tho. Penn’s academics are not necessarily much more difficult than any other prestigious school but the grading styles of many professors is minimal curving and the academic culture is very competitive to the point of being toxic. And Penn’s mental health support services (CAPS) isn’t well-funded nor are its policies particularly good for students that need mental health support.
I'd add that there's also a campus culture of people doing everything all the time - having a cool job/internship, being on the board of a club, doing research, going to parties, etc. - that can be really stressful.


Thank you for expanding. Like you only the stressful culture is my main issue, I'm chill with everything else. But OP didn't say really what he likes so I just generally listed some things people have mixed opinions about.


CAPS at Penn is technically part of the psychology department instead of student health so it has to share funding with the psych department—research projects, etc. If it were part of student health, it would get funding specifically earmarked for it, but as it stands, the CAPS budget is determined largely by the psych department heads.

And what I mean is that CAPS policies are lacking is that they treat it as a short-term solution/stop-gap measure (policies may not have been the correct word). Anyways. If students have serious mental health issues that they need help with, they typically end up sending the students to other doctors within the city. While this isn’t inherently a bad thing, the method in which they do this is basically “give a student a list of doctors and tell the student good luck”. For people with severe anxiety or depression, being that proactive about calling people and setting up appointments isn’t something that comes easily, nor is the perception of being turned away and pawned off onto someone else.
Thanks for taking the time to write such a good response. As for the competitive aspect, I don’t mind that very much because I am naturally very competitive and I think I handle stress well. As for mental health services, maybe it’s my pride but I don’t see myself using mental health support even if I needed it.

Winter is a bit of an issue since I come from California, does anyone who came from a sunny state have any comments on what it’s like adjusting?

Finally, the drinking, personally I don’t drink, from what you are saying it sounds like this might not be ideal but not ruin my social life either?

Glad I could be helpful. Though I feel compelled to say this as well: regardless of whether or not you end up applying and attending Penn, academic anxiety is real, especially in the academic culture of today’s world. If you think you may need help at all, please seek it.

Anyways. Moving away from that serious note. I know plenty of people from places that are much warmer than Cali that adapt fine, given the proper winter clothes. IIRC all of the dorms are heated (not all have AC tho), and all of the academic buildings have heat as well. Walking between buildings can be chilly, but so long as you have layers on you’ll be fine.

As for drinking, I don’t drink a ton either but there’s still lots to do. Much of the campus social culture revolves around frats but since it’s in a city, there’s lots to do that doesn’t include choking down a bunch of shitty beer.

I came to Penn from Texas. The winters are cold and a bit hard but ultimately not that big of a deal. You'll adjust and you'll be fine. I wouldn't let it deter you from applying ED if you like Penn otherwise.

Definitely look into the PEEP fly in Program. Even if you aren’t accepted they usually waive your application fee which helps. https://admissions.upenn.edu/peep

Thanks for the suggestion, however even though I don’t have the funds to travel to Penn I am definitely not low-income or underrepresented. In fact, I’m middle-class, White, a male, and both my parents went to college. Would it still be worth applying? Even then I don’t want to take the opportunity away from people who deserve it more than I do.

I'm a freshman here so definitely some bias as my experience with Penn personally is only in a Covid world. But l'm a bit frustrated and disappointed. I feel like at most turns Penn has let me down as a student. I know that Covid is serious and online learning is a challenge for everyone, and I really think professors are handling the change well. I guess my main frustration is comparing Penn's response to other schools. Only 2 days off this semester, no day off for Election Day, not bringing any students back, reversing the decision so late. The social and mental stress of classes is really taking its toll and I feel like the further this goes the more isolated I feel from my peers. I know we'll be there eventually, this just sucks. I'm also very grateful for my living situation and know that I have a lot to be grateful for.

This turned into a ramble but basically, is there anyway to hold the administration accountable? I really feel like decisions aren't really considering social and emotional health right now... and I feel like the administration doesn't seem to care much for us as individual students. Trying to hold on to hope for Spring but also wishing I had some way to turn these strong feelings into action or at least trying to hold the administration accountable.

Upperclassmen if you have any hopeful messages or stories of being on campus or even online l'd be happy to hear them. It's hard being a freshman never having experienced real college.

I’m not sure if you’re asking for stories of just “fun” things people do on campus, like happy memories, and I’m not a current student i graduated in 2017, but some of my best memories are from penn. That said, don’t expect the administration to do shit for you. When my mental health was bad at Penn, I went to CAPS and to be honest they were so bad I shelled out $180 a week out of my meager TA job salary to pay for a private therapist.

That said, some of my best memories are from Penn. I met so many wonderful people who I’m still in touch with daily or weekly to this day. I met my SO at Penn.

I’d go to DRL with other math majors and we’d get so lost in a problem we invited our 80-something professor (Professor Kazdan) out to smokes - he said yes.

My freshman year a friend and I were in Rippe (I forgot the spelling) library in the quad working on writing sem and we had a watermelon with us so we said fuck it, let’s have a catch. After 3 or 4 tosses the watermelon EXPLODED all over the library and we bailed fast.

My freshman year (please admin if you’re reading this don’t get mad), a few of my friends and I stole the Penn flag from Fischer fine arts library.

There are so many other funny and hilarious memories (you can PM me for stories but I’m less inclined to share anything less appropriate than this in public haha) and that’s what makes Penn, Penn. I can’t imagine how tough it is going to college with covid, so if I can be of a resource in any way, my inbox is open.

Edit: based on some of the responses i worry that hearing all this made the atmosphere worse due to the contrast of circumstances, as opposed to hopeful for the future - If that’s the case, I encourage to reach out to whatever resources you have available. Whether it’s your friends, or family, or CAPS - all are here to help you. If it’s your first semester and you haven’t met any people PLEASE reach out to your TAs. When I was younger and my back didn’t ache every morning I was a
Whoever decided that a fall break was not necessary deserves nothing
No mental reset, no rest or breaks, continuous problem sets along with recruiting, this school literally doesn’t care at all. I’m lucky enough to only be angry, but so many other students are suffering much worse and our mental health collectively has hit rock bottom.

I hope everyone is holding it together because I know I’m this close to raging at my professors to stop giving us so much work. Or my head might implode. Whichever comes first~

Usually things are stressful, but there's at least some reward, gratification, some fun, just something to look forward to. Not this semester. Not taking 6.5CU through zoom in my bedroom. There's just the stress, endless work, and crappy grades, and the feeling you're constantly behind. I'm on the verge of tears 24-7 and I just want this to be over. I'm not the type to say I hate Penn, I love this school and being here and my major, but I really hate this.

Not trying to be rude or anything, but did you have any other choice regarding taking 6.5 credits? Personally, I'm just much less efficient with work at home, so I know that would make me miserable.

Encouraging professors to slow down pace for a week works wonders -- super nice in one of my classes just not to have to think about it. Obviously no where the ideal -- but worth a try.

Unfortunately most STEM professors don’t give a crap when you ask because they assume we should be able to do it 😭

Totally unacceptable. STEM classes, such as intro CIS course are notoriously labor intensive and it is ridiculous not to give breaks. We all need them. Hope someone is listening out there! Professors, please.

There is a blindingly obvious solution: one day breaks throughout the semester to make up the balance, which would not encourage traveling but would save us from zoom hell temporarily

they should give us off indigenous peoples' day and election day to make up for the two days we lost. students are traveling regardless of whether we are "on break" since most course material is accessible at any time. we are physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted not only from online classes, but from the plethora of other problems covid has brought.

I am quite frankly confused as to why a break is not provided as it normally would be. I do understand that travel is to be discouraged, so discourage it. Students need and deserve a mental rest or need to catch up with what is proving to be a difficult learning and studying environment. I hope ALL of the Penn professors can see this as a problem. There is burnout happening and it is NOT necessary for college students to experience burnout. Learning at Penn is challenging, do not make it a laborious stressful sleep-depriving chore.

Don't hate on the professors. Many are struggling just as much as us. Many have a lot more life issues, which are often more pressing than an undergrad student's life issues. Direct your displeasure to the administration. They are the ones who stonewalled, "fed-spoke", and continue to maintain the illusion of control while tossing around the hot potato of responsibility for our college experience.

Grief over losing senior year
I am a senior right now and losing my senior year of college has been awful for my mental health. I spent my first two years at Penn struggling with depression and a serious eating disorder so I was never able to apply myself enough to join clubs or have a real social life. I spent junior year in therapy and by Spring 2020 I finally felt like myself again. I joined some clubs and felt like things were going to be okay. Then covid happened. I still felt hopeful because I thought senior year would be the year where I came into myself and would be able to apply everything I had learned to have a great year and graduate feeling proud of my college experience. I truly believe my senior year would have been amazing and made up for the disappointing college years that came before.

Instead I've been stuck in an abusive home environment for a year and will be graduating with very little to show for my college experience. I am so sad that my year will be the only Penn class to have never gotten hey day, feb club, and we possibly won't get graduation either. I had saved so many interesting classes to take my senior year and now I'm having to take them online, which I have a really hard time staying engaged with. I learned almost nothing this past semester online even though I'm taking the most important classes of my major. It makes me incredibly sad that I will never again experience an in person lecture or study in our libraries again. I'll never be able to go to Smokes. All the things that make college worth it, completely stripped. My personal, social, and academic life have all taken serious hits and I don't have another year of college to make up for it.

I guess this is just a post venting about covid and senior year but also I wanted to know if other seniors are experiencing this? No one is talking about it. It felt like the whole world felt bad for the Class of 2020 because they missed two months of college but the Class of 2021 is missing our last 1.5 years of college. (disclaimer that I know this is nothing compared to the actual losses people have experienced this year) I wish the Class of 2021 Board would have some kind of event where we could all reflect and have collective grieving over what we have lost. Because right now I just feel totally isolated and like I'm the only one having such a hard time and missing what could have been of our senior year. It truly feels like grief at this point because I feel so stuck; always thinking about what could have been and also having no way to make it better because there's no way out of our present circumstances.

I’m sorry that you went through this your freshman and sophomore years. I’m in a similar position where I developed a chronic illness my freshman year, and just started to get better in Spring 2020. I’m also home in a not great situation and I’ve been getting through it with the thought that we’re almost to graduation. Ultimately, college was a huge L, but that doesn’t mean the rest of our lives have to be as well. In a few short months, we’ll have the ability to pursue our own sort of freedom, and even though the job market stinks right now, the covid situation isn’t going to last indefinitely. Please know that you aren’t the only one who feels that they missed out on the college experience and take solace that this too shall pass. Also, I know for a fact that members of the ‘21 CB are on this sub, so I’m sure that that this idea will get back to them. I think having a community grief period would be really good for the class. Hang in there and PM me if you need a commiserating buddy :’)

I'm sorry you're going through this too! It's nice to know that we're not alone. I guess it's hard because I really don't think college should have been an L and it's hard to get over the feeling that something was stolen from us? It really really sucks to not have been able to have this year to redeem myself and have fun. Like I know I have the rest of my life but college is such a specific environment where everyone you know lives right next to you and you have experiences (parties, college bars, class events, clubs, etc) reserved just for you and people you know. Ultimately I do know things will get better and I have to just keep reminding myself of that. Sending you love!

Also if anyone on the 21 CB is reading this: if the public is vaccinated by the summer can you guys organize some sort of feb club / traditions do over for May/June for people who are still in Philly? lol

Yep, we are working through all of the options and looking to have all of the traditions. Some of them may look a little different based on the restrictions but we really want to give our class the best senior year ever. It's been a tough time, but high hopes for 2021

I echo a lot of your feelings and just want to say that it really does suck. Truth is we lost out on some pretty amazing experiences and moments, and we’re never getting them back. I’ve tried to make the experience a positive one as best I can though. For example, I’ve refined my work ethic so I’m productive no matter the environment or circumstances. When things were normal, due to my own anxiety/depression, I passed up a lot of opportunities to go out with friends. I’ve learned to take advantage of the opportunities and moments I do have, as I’ve realized things really can change in an instant. I’ve learned to appreciate the small stuff, and I have a whole new perspective on independence (also have been home with dysfunctional family) and freedom. I’ve taken advantage of the extra time from not having to travel anywhere by totally overhauling my physical fitness. So I suppose I’m dealing with the sadness by learning what I can from the experience. I hope someday I’ll reflect upon this college/COVID disaster and be a wiser and more thoughtful person who makes better decisions because of it. There is nothing that can be done to redo or restart a lost college experience, but I refuse to not grow from my experience—this is the line of thinking I circle back to when I start getting the blues from having missed everything.

I also feel sad, too, but here’s the thing. People’s college careers get disrupted for all kinds of reasons all the time. We just don’t hear about them because they’re normally not during a pandemic. People quietly leave school or take short or long breaks because they run out of money, a parent dies, some other family emergency, pregnancy, etc. Not so much at Penn because we’re an extremely well-funded, high-achieving, driven lot but it’s common enough. So I guess what I’m saying is that there is no “ideal college experience,” and for me, I have to let go of that in order to move on to the next phase in my life.

That said, I also saved all of the classes that I’m really excited about for my last semester. I’m really not looking forward to attending them via zoom. Not. At. All. I do sympathize.

I can relate. At this point, I've just accepted that I'm not going to get any of the things I was looking forward to during my Junior and Senior years. It sucks, but if I ruminate over it for too long then I'll never get over it. Looking to the future has been more helpful for me, so now I'm much more worried about getting a job so that I can afford rent than I am about not getting a senior year or graduation.

The loss of your college experience is extremely upsetting. I don't have any solutions for you but to say you are not alone and that you can bend your life path a little differently perhaps. Learning and doing things collaboratively doesn't end with college..... It sounds like you have made remarkable personal progress. I know you will eventually overcome the new obstacles you face in this pandemic. In the meantime, keep reaching out and engaging and doing as much as you can with the time you still have at college. Be well.

I’m so sorry to hear this. As a fellow senior as well, I resonate with a lot of stuff that you said. If you need anything or just need someone to reach out to just talk and vent, please feel free to message! Hope you are holding up okay. This year has been such an immensely challenging experience towards everyone at some level but I am hoping everything will work out once we graduate, if we make it there. Try to stay positive!

Penn Alum & Parent
I am reading these posts which such displeasure at both the administration and the professors. You students are being heard. Hang in there. The professors and administrators are both there to educate you not break you. I am not one that believes that education needs to be this difficult. Professors can be a lot more forgiving with the assignments and still get through the curriculum and test mastery. Come on Penn, you can do better here. And, Penn, I hope you are working on gathering the tests you will need to hopefully open up in the Spring and perhaps coop the Inn at Penn (a nice place to quarantine?).
idk if it’s just me but I get super overwhelmed by how many people here can afford to go out clubbing every wknd, always eat out, etc and how different their pre-college living situations were vs mine. Don’t get me wrong im so grateful for all the opportunities I’ve gotten but idk it feels unfair that I have to worry about working hours to pay off bills (complicated fam issues so I pay for almost everything I have for myself like my phone bill, textbook stuff, etc) and balance school and extracurriculars and maintaining good mental health/eating, smth ive struggled w a lot this past semester. It feels wrong but I do get jealous of the more well off students bc my worries abt my finances have caused me sm stress
Back at Penn I didn't associate with the obscenely wealthy (or many wealthy or upper middle class folk in general). I was FGLI, and most of my friends were too. It helps when you have common ground solidarity and community.
i fully relate as a highly-aided poc at this predominantly white institution... and not to mention all the mental health struggles i have that are caused by financial health security... it's crazy how ppl can travel so often and party so much. like how do u even afford that?


A wise friend once told me: “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Yup. There are some obscenely rich kids here. Ignore them and focus on yourself and your goals. Whenever I would feel that way, I’d make a list of what I’m grateful for: my brain, the opportunity to study at Penn, the beautiful architecture on campus, that I’m not alone - the other half of the undergraduate population receives some form of financial aid, my awesome professors, what I was learning, and the opportunity to land a good job after I graduate. Believe me, all that bullshit fades far into the background once you leave. I also agree with pp to surround yourself with normal people.


I feel this so hard as a fgli minority student.Bit older here and didn't do undergrad at UPenn.
I am much older, and I am a foreigner. When I went to get my bachelor's in Brazil, I went through this same situation. I worked all day and went to college in the evening, Monday through Friday, for 4 years. Some evenings, I could only afford a small bag of popcorn. Some evenings I could not afford to take two buses after class at 10:30 PM to get home, so I walked 4 miles and used the money for another snack. I just want to tell you not to let a comparison to other people's lives affect you. They are taking the same classes as you. Because I had to work so hard to pay for my degree and pay for bills at home to help my parents, I ended up giving more value to my academic experience. Good Luck.




                                            But that is life. When I went to university, it was difficult for me to afford $10 meals, and I bought alot of textbooks used and some previous editions. I used to commute to school 3 hrs/day because I couldn't afford to live at school. I saw students spending my annual expense within a week.

                                               When you graduate as well, there will be a difference in how much you have to network/work compared to the people with connections.

                                               Maybe your next generation will have it easier once you make it.

I used to get so much social anxiety at seeing people go out on trips across the country or the state every weekend, go to expensive restaurants and clubbing all the time. It made me feel horrible because my life wasn’t like that. But it’s just part of that unfair gap, I guess. We don’t get what they have, and we may never have it.

Haha. The issue is we all blame "Penn". But who the hell is Penn? What's his linked-in? Oh wait I do follow "them/it" already. Uh Mom (Prez Amy) G., Can you like ask your son to pick up the goddamn phone or send an email out saying, the exact words "chill homefry, we don't know how to solve this Jawn, but we WILL DO this pt1,pt2,....pt3 and NOT DO this pt1, pt2,...pt3 (of course subject to change but only under strict evidence to do so). PENN (and hopefully covid) OUT "
